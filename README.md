# Medical Transcriptions with OpenAI

This project demonstrates how to extract structured medical information from free-form clinical transcriptions using OpenAI's API, then map those findings to ICD-10 codes. It’s built to help medical professionals, data scientists, and engineers quickly turn long, messy clinical notes into actionable, standardized data.

## Why this project exists

Clinical transcriptions contain valuable information about patients' age, primary diagnosis, recommended treatments, and more. But the text is unstructured and often noisy. This project shows how to automatically extract those key details and convert them into a consistent format that can be used for analytics, billing (ICD-10 coding), research, or further automation.

## What it does
- Reads a set of anonymized medical transcriptions from a CSV file.
- Sends each transcription to OpenAI’s chat model to extract specific fields (age, specialty, recommended treatment, primary diagnosis).
- Uses basic rule-based mappings to suggest ICD-10 codes from the extracted primary diagnosis.
- Saves the result as `structured_medical_data.csv` for downstream use.

## Key features
- Easy-to-follow example for building an extraction pipeline with the OpenAI API.
- Speciality-aware ICD-10 mappings for more accurate code suggestions.
- Rate-limiting delay and error handling in the notebook to keep things robust during batch processing.

## Tech Stack & Tools
- Python: The language used for the notebook and scripts.
- Pandas: For reading and writing CSV files and managing tables of data.
- Jupyter Notebook: The interactive environment (`notebook.ipynb`) 

## Getting started
1. Install Python (3.8+ recommended).
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows (bash.exe) environment
```

3. Install required packages (e.g. pandas and the OpenAI SDK):

```bash
pip install pandas openai
```

4. Set your OpenAI API key in the environment to keep it safe:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

5. Open and run `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter, the notebook shows how to call the model, handle the responses, and write the final CSV.

## Files you’ll see here
- `notebook.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the entire extraction and mapping workflow.
- `data/transcriptions.csv`: Example dataset of anonymized clinical transcriptions.
- `structured_medical_data.csv`: Output CSV generated by the notebook with structured fields and ICD-10 codes.


## What you can build next
- Expand mapping logic with a professional ICD-10 coding dataset or a lookup API.
- Add automated validation and human-in-the-loop corrections for high-confidence results.
- Integrate with EMR systems or reporting dashboards for analytics, operations, or case management.
